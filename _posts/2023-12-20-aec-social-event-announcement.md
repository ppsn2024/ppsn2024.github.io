On Monday evening, September 16, 2024 the first social event will take place at the Ars Electronica Center (AEC) Linz, where we will enjoy an immersive mixed reality show followed by a flying dinner at the rooftop restaurant.

We invite you to the **[Ars Electronica Center (AEC) Linz][aec]{:target="_blank"}** *-- museum of the future --* where interactive stations, works of art, research projects, large-scale projections and laboratories are presented. The Ars Electronica Center invites you to exciting and inspiring excursions into the future fields of artificial intelligence and neuroscience, robotics and autonomous mobility, as well as genetic engineering and biotechnology. Experience something that cannot be found anywhere else in the world: 16 x 9 meters of wall and another 16 x 9 meters of floor projection, laser tracking and 3D animations make the Deep Space 8K something very special indeed. Here, image worlds are projected in 8K resolution and raised to a completely new, unprecedented level. After the Deep Space 8k Session you’ll enjoy a flying dinner at the rooftop restaurant.
