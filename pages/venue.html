                    On Tuesday, September 17, 2024 - i.e., the second evening of the main conference - we invite you to the Freistädter Brauhaus, where you will have the opportunity to taste the local beer, lemonades, etc. and enjoy the cuisine of the "Mühlviertel" region, where this year's edition of PPSN is based. After a welcome drink at the brewery, we will have dinner at their restaurant with regional specialities, accompanied by the PPSN award show.
