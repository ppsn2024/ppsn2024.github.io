    <h2>LNCS Proceedings</h2>

          We are proud to announce that our proceedings will be published as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer
          Science (LNCS). The links to the springer publication site will be provided here as soon as the process is
          completed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          “The series Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), including its subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI), has established itself as a medium for the publication of new developments in computer science and information technology research and teaching.
The cornerstone of LNCS’s editorial policy is its unwavering commitment to report the latest results from all areas of computer science and information technology research, development, and education. LNCS has always enjoyed close cooperation with the computer science R & D community, with numerous renowned academics, and with prestigious institutes and learned societies. Our mission is to serve this community by providing an invaluable publication service.
LNCS commenced publication in 1973 and rapidly attracted attention, not least because of its unprecedented publication turnaround times. In the late 1990s we developed a systematic approach to providing LNCS in a full-text electronic version, in parallel to the printed books. Another new feature introduced in the late 1990s was the conceptualization of a couple of color-cover sublines. Still, original research results reported in proceedings and postproceedings remain the core of LNCS.”
