                PPSN was originally designed to bring together researchers and practitioners in the field of Natural
                Computing, the study of computing approaches which are gleaned from natural models. Today, the
                conference series has evolved and welcomes works on all types of iterative optimization heuristics.
                Notably, we also welcome submissions on connections between search heuristics and machine learning
                or other artificial intelligence approaches. Submissions covering the entire spectrum of work,
                ranging from rigorously derived mathematical results to carefully crafted empirical studies, are
                invited.

                The PPSN 2024 Organizing Committee invites proposals for workshops to
                be held in conjunction with PPSN 2024. The workshops should be forums for
                presenting and discussing new emerging approaches or for critical reflections
                within a subfield. They provide an excellent opportunity to meet people with
                similar interests, to be exposed to cutting-edge research and to exchange ideas
                in an informal setting. The organizers of an accepted workshop are responsible
                for its coordination, publicity (i.e., for sending out call for papers/abstracts,
                invitation of participants and speakers), and maintaining a webpage providing a
                list of accepted talks. Paper submission and reviewing (if applicable) is to be
                organized by workshop organizers.<br />

                Moreover, organizers can decide on setting up a half-day or full-day workshop.
                The workshop format is also up to the organizers. However, we encourage interactive
                sessions that foster discussion and active exchange of ideas. We suggest soliciting
                concept papers or abstracts of not more than a few pages’ length, instead of full
                papers.

                    room and technical equipment for local presentations. Hybrid workshop formats
                    will not be considered. In case of pandemic-caused restrictions, the workshops

                The PPSN 2024 Organizing Committee invites proposals for tutorials to be
                held in conjunction with PPSN 2024. The tutorial topic should enjoy broad
                interest within the community, ranging from an established or emerging
                research topic within the field itself, or a related field, to an interesting
                application area. The proposed topic should facilitate a gentle introduction
                to the research area, but it should also cover the most important contributions
                in depth. The planned duration of each tutorial is 90 minutes. We strongly
                encourage interactive sessions including, e.g., demos of tools and discussions
                research perspectives in the presented domains.
