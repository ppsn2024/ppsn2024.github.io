                The PPSN 2024 conference will be held in Hagenberg, Upper Austria, September 14–18, 2024. The workshops,
                tutorials and conference will be held “on-site” only. The participants should take this into account in
                their planning. The local organizers will provide an adequate room and technical equipment for local
                presentations.

                <h3>Scope</h3>
                <p>
                    PPSN was originally designed to bring together researchers and practitioners in the field of Natural
                    Computing, the study of computing approaches which are gleaned from natural models. Today, the
                    conference series has evolved and welcomes works on all types of iterative optimization heuristics.
                    Notably, we also welcome submissions on connections between search heuristics and machine learning
                    or other artificial intelligence approaches. Submissions covering the entire spectrum of work,
                    ranging from rigorously derived mathematical results to carefully crafted empirical studies, are
                    invited.

                <p>
                    Following PPSN’s unique tradition, all accepted papers will be presented during poster sessions and
                    will be included in the proceedings. The proceedings will be published in the Lecture Notes in
                    Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer.
