                    <b>Oliver Schütze</b> received a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Paderborn, Germany, in
                    2004. He is currently professor at the Cinvestav-IPN in Mexico City, Mexico. His research interests
                    focus on numerical and evolutionary optimization with an emphasis on multi-objective optimization
                    problems. He has co-authored more than 170 publications including 2 monographic books, 5 text books
                    and 17 edited books. Google Scholar reports more than 4,500 citations and a Hirsch index of 35.
                    During his career he received several prices and awards. For instance, he is co-author of two papers
                    that won the IEEE CIS Outstanding Paper Award (for the IEEE TEC papers of 2010 and 2012), and is
                    recipient of the H. S. Hsu Award 2022. He is Editor-in-Chief of the journal Mathematical and
                    Computational Applications, and member of the Editorial Board for Applied Soft Computing,
                    Computational Optimization and Applications, Engineering Optimization, Results in Control and
                    Optimization, and IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation. He is founder of the workshop
                    series Numerical and Evolutionary Optimization (NEO). Dr. Schuetze is member of the Mexican Academy
                    of Sciences (AMC) and the National Network of Researchers (SNI Level III).

                    <b>Bernardino Romera-Paredes</b> (Google DeepMind) is a former core team member of AlphaFold2 and
                    AlphaTensor and now research scientist at Google DeepMind in London. At PPSN 2024 Bernardino
                    Romera-Paredes will present his current research regarding the evolution of new heuristics,
                    supported by pairing a pre-trained LLM and an automated "evaluator", with his keynote "FunSearch:
                    Discovering new mathematics and algorithms using Large Language Models". In this talk I will present
                    FunSearch, a method to search for new solutions in mathematics and computer science. FunSearch works
                    by pairing a pre-trained LLM, whose goal is to provide creative solutions in the form of computer
                    code, with an automated “evaluator”, which guards against hallucinations and incorrect ideas. By
                    leveraging these two components within an evolutionary algorithm, initial solutions “evolve” into
                    new knowledge. I will present the application of FunSearch to a central problem in extremal
                    combinatorics — the cap set problem — where we discover new constructions of large cap sets going
                    beyond the best known ones, both in finite dimensional and asymptotic cases. This represents the
                    first discoveries made for established open problems using LLMs. Then, I will present the
                    application of FunSearch to an algorithmic problem, online bin packing, which showcases the
                    generality of the method. In this use case, FunSearch finds new heuristics that improve upon widely
                    used baselines. I will conclude the talk by discussing the implications of searching in the space of
                    code.
